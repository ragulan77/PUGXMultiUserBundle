PUGXMultiUserBundle
=============

The PUGXMultiUserBundle extends FOSUserBundle adding the feature to handle users of different types.
For now only supports the ORM db driver and is based on the doctrine2 inheritance.

PLZ don't use this bundle, you may want to use the original at https://github.com/PUGX/PUGXMultiUserBundle
